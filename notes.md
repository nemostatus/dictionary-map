A Map in JavaScript is a class that allows you to store a value at a specific key,
With objects you can pretty much only use strings as your keys, but a Map can have any value as a key

const obj = {
  a: 'b',
  1: 2
}

console.log(Object.keys(obj))
// ["a", "1"]

const map = new Map([
  ['a', 'b'],
  [1, 2],
  [{ key: 'value' }, 'obj']
])
console.log(Object.keys(map))
// ["a", 1, { key: "value" }]

In order to create a map you need to pass it an array of arrays instead of an object. Also, the console.log for the map technically wonâ€™t print out this exact result since it returns an iterator instead of an array, but you can convert it to an array to get this result [...map.keys()].
